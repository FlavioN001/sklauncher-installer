# SKlauncher installer for Fedora
This is an instalation script for installing SKlauncher (a minecraft launcher) on linux. Currently, it only works on Red Hat based distros like fedora, which is the one I tested it on, as it my second distro of choice.

# Why does this even exists?
Currently, a Flatpak for sklauncher, my favourite Minecraft launcher,isn't available as it's still in development by the SKlauncher group. So there's no easy way to install this Minecraft launcher on Linux without opening a terminal. The easiest way to install it is if you're using Arch Linux because there is an AUR package for it, but sadly this also isn't available on other distros like Fedora, that is my second favourite distro.



# How to use:

To install , run the Instalador SKlauncher.sh script

To unistall, run the Desinstalar SKlauncher.sh script
