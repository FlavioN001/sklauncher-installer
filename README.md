# SKlauncher installer for Fedora
This is an instalation script for installing [SKlauncher](https://skmedix.pl/) (a minecraft launcher) on linux. Currently, it only works on [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) based distros like [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), which is the one I tested it on, as it is my second distro of choice.



# Why does this even exists?
Currently, a [Flatpak](https://flathub.org/) for [SKlauncher](https://skmedix.pl/), my favourite Minecraft launcher, still [isn't available](https://skmedix.pl/downloads#linux) as it's still in development by the [SKlauncher group](https://twitter.com/sklaunch). So there's no easy way to install this Minecraft launcher on Linux without opening a terminal. The easiest way to install it is if you're using [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) because there is an [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/sklauncher-bin) for it, but sadly this also isn't available on other distros like [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/), that is my second favourite distro.



# How to use:

To install, [download the installer script](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/FlavioN001/sklauncher-installer/blob/main/Instalador%20SKlauncher.sh), make it executable as an application and double click on it to run.

To uninstall, [download the uninstaller script](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/FlavioN001/sklauncher-installer/blob/main/Desinstalar%20SKlauncher.sh), make it executable as an application and double click on it to run.

If any error occurs, try runing the script on a termnal and maybe try fixing it, it's a very simple script!
If there are any easy fixes i could make, maybe upload a pull request
